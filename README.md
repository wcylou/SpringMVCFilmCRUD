## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project
## Week 7 Pair Skill Distillery
### Wilson Lou and Jeremy Botta

### Overview
- This project is our first full-stack Spring MVC project that allows users to create, update, retrieve, and delete films/actors in a database.
- Added in intro and end pages using JavaScript for our film theme!

### Topics
* Java
* Spring Tool Suite
* HTML
* CSS (Bootstrap)
* MySQL
* GitHub
* Gradel

### How to Run
- The user is prompted with an opening screen where they can navigate to the menu. This allows you to search for films/actors by ID, films by keyword (within title and description), add films/actors and also delete films.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned
**1. Connecting JSP/Controller/DAO Implementation**
- Figuring out how to pass variables through to each was tricky especially when using Model and View with various names for each object.
- Setting views in Model and View
- Using Request Param in our Request Mapping.

**2. Updating Films/Actors**
- Creating multiple JSP pages so that the first would retrieve and auto-populate the boxes for the film. Originally, we used the value attribute for form:form action but realised this wasn't possible so we switched to a basic form.

**3. GitHub**
- Previously, we had only used GitHub for personal projects but as this was a pair project, merge conflicts cropped up when we pulled and pushed.
- We tried to work on different parts of the project as much as we could but ultimately found that communication was key to ensuring these were kept at a minimum.
